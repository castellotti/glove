## Vibe's settings

Vibe's `config.toml` is read-only here (glove renders it at each start). A
choice made in Vibe's UI, such as `/theme` or `/model`, lasts for this run at
most and is never saved; Vibe shows no error. If the user wants a lasting
choice, tell them it goes in the session file (`glove-session.yml`):
`harness_config` for Vibe's config, or the `llm` extension's `model`.
